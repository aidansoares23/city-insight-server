//   --wipeSeededReviews      Deletes only reviews by seed users (safer)
//   --skipMetrics            Don't write manual metrics

// What it does:
// 1) Upserts cities/{slug} and RESETS city_stats/{slug} to minimal shape
// 2) Seeds users + reviews (deterministic review IDs)
// 3) Optionally syncs manual city_metrics
// 4) Recomputes city_stats from reviews for all seeded cities (also recomputes livability)
